Plastic
=======

Plastic is boilerplate code that helps you to build a simple website for your game studio. Plastic uses the static blogging engine [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) which is written in Ruby. Compared to blog systems like Wordpress, a static blogging engine does not require any database or server-side scripts, thus making a site easier to deploy, faster to load and be able to handle more requests.

With Jekyll you do changes locally by editing text files in the project directory. To publish your changes, run the `jekyll build` command and then upload the contents of the `_site` folder to your FTP server.

# Local setup on Windows

## Install Ruby

To run Jekyll locally you need to have Ruby installed.

First, download and install [Ruby 1.9.3](http://dl.bintray.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/rubyinstaller-1.9.3-p551.exe?direct).

Now download the [Ruby Development Kit](https://github.com/downloads/oneclick/rubyinstaller/DevKit-tdm-32-4.5.2-20111229-1559-sfx.exe
).

Double-click the self-extracting executable and choose `C:\DevKit` as the directory to install the files into.

Open `Start Command Prompt with Ruby` and type the following:

```
cd C:\DevKit
ruby dk.rb init
ruby dk.rb install
```

Ruby is now installed on your Windows machine.

## Install Jekyll

To install Jekyll, make sure you're in the Ruby Command Prompt, `cd` into the project directory and then run:

```
gem install bundler
bundle install --without heroku
```

# Run the site locally

Start the Jekyll server to be able to view the site locally in your browser.

```
jekyll serve --no-watch
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:4000/ in your browser to view the site.

To preview your changes (such as a new blog post), open a second Command Prompt and then run the following command to export the site into the `_site` folder:

```
jekyll build
```

(The second Command Prompt allows you to keep the server running, instead of stopping and starting it again between building.)

# Site structure

All folders in the project that do _not_ start with an underscore are accessible on the website. 
The homepage is represented by index.html in the project directory.

# Game pages

## Adding a new game

To add a new game, duplicate an existing game folder (e.g. `future-unfolding`) to use as a template. Name the new folder after your game using `-` instead of spaces. Open the file `_includes/navigation` and add a link to the game page inside the `ul` element.

## Promoter integration

You can load public review quotes and awards from [Promoter](http://www.promoterapp.com) automatically for each game page. In the Front Matter of your game page, set the `promoter-url` variable to your the url of your public page (without `http://`). The reviews and awards will be displayed inside the `<ul id="awards"></ul>` and `<ul id="reviews"></ul>` container tags. You can move the container tags around on your page however you wish. You can also delete one of them if you only want to display awards or review quotes.

# Writing blog posts

To create a new blog post, create a new file in `_posts` with the following file name syntax: `2015-01-31-blog-post-title.md`

You can use both [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) as well as plain HTML to write your blog posts.

You can keep unfinished drafts of your blog posts in the [drafts folder](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/drafts/).

# Uploading images

For best loading times, images are stored on Amazon S3 and served via the Amazon CloudFront CDN. To upload an image do the following steps:

1. Sign into Amazon
2. Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-west-2
3. Select your bucket
4. Select the folder where you want to upload the new file
5. Click on the `Upload` button and select the file to upload
6. Right-click the file you uploaded and select `Make Public`

To use an uploaded image on the site use the following syntax:

```
<img src="{{site.asset_url}}/blog/my-image.png" alt="My image">
```

It is recommended to store a copy of each image in the `_img` folder as a local backup, using the same directory structure as the Amazon S3 bucket.

# Images sizes

Images should have double the size of the size that they are rendered in the browser to account for high-resolution (Retina) displays if possible.

* Blog post images should have a width of 1620px if they should span the whole column
* Game screenshots for image galleries should use the original size so they are easy for press to download and use in good quality 

# Layouts

There are five different layout templates available:

* page (general pages such as contact)
* post (blog posts)
* game (game pages)

You can choose the layout for a page using the so-called [Front Matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) in Jekyll (a fancy word for meta data).

# Deploy

To build and deploy the site run the following command:

```
glynn
```

When being asked, enter your FTP password.
